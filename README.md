IRCBot.v2
=========

What is it?
-----------
IRCBot.v2 is an improved version of IRCBot. Basically, it detects messages and can send responses to said messages.

Where can I get it?
-------------------
Currently, there is no set location for it to be downloaded, but if you wish, you can download the source from here on GitHub and compile it. I plan on getting it hosted on one of my sites/servers as soon as I can get it to become stable.

Is it expandable?
-----------------
Right now? No.
I do have plans, however, for adding a module interface. Something where you can write your own VB.NET code, have the program automatically detect it on launch, and it will compile it for you and add it to the list of things to check. This is a major goal, but for now, there are a few other pressing matters.

Is there help available?
------------------------
YES! Just go visit http://data.acorptech.com.au:82/projects/IRCBot.v2 to see it! At the time of writing this, it is still a work in progress, and the site it resides on is yet to be moved from its temporary location to http://www.xeon927.net, but I shall update this readme again when the time comes for that to all change.
